  "Then what is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? Great in every respect. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God [His very words]. What then? If some did not believe or were unfaithful [to God], their lack of belief will not nullify and make invalid the faithfulness of God and His word, will it? Certainly not! Let God be found true [as He will be], though every person be found a liar, just as it is written [in Scripture], What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, as it is written:‚ÄúNone is righteous, no, not one;no one understands;no one seeks for God.All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;no one does good,not even one.‚Äù‚ÄúTheir throat is an open grave;they use their tongues to deceive.‚Äù‚ÄúThe venom of asps is under their lips.‚Äù‚ÄúTheir mouth is full of curses and bitterness.‚Äù‚ÄúTheir feet are swift to shed blood;in their paths are ruin and misery,and the way of peace they have not known.‚Äù‚ÄúThere is no fear of God before their eyes.‚ÄùNow we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.";
